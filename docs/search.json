    "text": "Abstract\nThis article summarises the various lines of theoretical research on the relationship between neighbourhoods, crime, and insecurity, as well as the different models of crime prevention at the neighbourhood level and the discussion on the role that the police can play in neighbourhood security. The article suggests that a number of lessons can be drawn from this literature, pointing to the importance of the community dimension in crime prevention and the problems it entails, as well as the need for a reform of the security system that focuses on co-production, inter-institutional collaboration, and a certain degree of police minimalism in solving these problems."

After spending much of my career, 25 years, working in the UK and the USA, I left my position as Professor of Quantitative Criminology and Head of the Criminology Department at the University of Manchester in 2020 to join the University of Seville (Spain) as a Talentia Senior Distinguished Researcher. Currently, I am still employed by the University of Seville where I contribute to the teaching of their criminology degree.

    "text": "Traditional textbooks\n\nPolíticas y Estrategias de Prevención del Delito y Seguridad Ciudadana (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nLink,  \nI didn´t really aim to write a textbook when I wrote this, but I can understand why it ended up being used that way. It reviews the conceptual, theoretical and empirical basis for the key preventative and crime control approaches. It is used on crime prevention or politics of crime course units. It´s now a bit dated. But there´s nothing like it in the Spanish market yet. I know I should aim to publish a second edition at some point. It´s just that life is too short and don´t know when I will find the time to do so.\n\n\n\n\nA Beginner’s Guide to Statistics for Criminology and Criminal Justice Using R (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\nLink,  \nThis is a companion text for David Weisburd et al. intro to stats for criminology and criminal justice students (here). Reka, Samuel and me were approached by the other coauthors if memory doesn´t fail me, to help with this. I´m not a big fan of the Weisburd´s book. I think its approach to teaching stats is somehow dated. I much prefer other intro to stats texts and approaches these days. But if you want to learn some basic code for running standard applications in an intro to stats text here you will find some examples.\n\n\n\n\nInstituciones de Control del Delito (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nLink,  \nThis is a textbook I coordinated and that aims to be used as the main reference text on course units that introduce the criminal justice system in Spain. This kind of course units receive different names in Spanish criminology degrees (introduction to the criminal justice system, institutions of penal control, etc.). Typically they are offered in the first or second semester of the first year, so the text is written with that audience in mind. I managed to persuade what I think is a quite impressive array of well-established and more junior scholars with a particular expertise on the different topics covered. My hope is to get this updated with a second editon in a few years time.\n\n\n\n\nCrime Mapping and Spatial Data Analysis using R (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nLink,  \nAnother collaboration with my colleague Reka Solymosi. We taught together a course unit at UoM for many years on this. It was offered both to UG and PG students. This book took the teaching materials we used for that unit to the next level. Some of the code is likely outdated, given the fast development of R spatial abilities and packages. But I believe still it is a useful resource. You can find the open bookdown version of this volume here.\n\n\n\n\nPrevención y tratamiento de la delincuencia (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\nLink,  \nThis is a textbook developed by colleagues at UNED and that aims to be useful for students taking course units on crime prevention and/or offender treatment. I helped to identify some of the topics and authors for the crime prevention chapters and authored two chapters on the book. Here you will find two chapters, one by Lorea Arenas on crime scripts and another by Maria Contreras on crime prevention frameworks and tools developed by Paul Ekblom, that I think are really useful from a practical standpoint."
