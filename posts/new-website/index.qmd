## Summary

And so after a few years relying on other R packages and Hugo for maintaining a website that I never really had the time to update, I have decided to try again this time with Quarto. From what I am seeing so fat, this is a more streamlined and probably more sustainable format for keeping up an academic website. Time will tell. It is likely the look of this will change over time as I get more familiar with what Quarto has to offer. Surely, it will take time until I upload here all the required content. But for now this will do.
