## Abstract

This article summarises the various lines of theoretical research on the relationship between neighbourhoods, crime, and insecurity, as well as the different models of crime prevention at the neighbourhood level and the discussion on the role that the police can play in neighbourhood security. The article suggests that a number of lessons can be drawn from this literature, pointing to the importance of the community dimension in crime prevention and the problems it entails, as well as the need for a reform of the security system that focuses on co-production, inter-institutional collaboration, and a certain degree of police minimalism in solving these problems.
