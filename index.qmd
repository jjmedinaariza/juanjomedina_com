:::{#hero-heading}

I am a social scientist interested in crime and crime control and prevention policies, what is often referred to as a criminologist. After spending much of my career, 25 years, working in the UK and the USA, I left my position as Professor of Quantitative Criminology and Head of the Criminology Department at the University of Manchester in 2020 to join the University of Seville (Spain) as a Talentia Senior Distinguished Researcher. The Talentia Senior Scheme was a program of the Andalusian Government aimed at attracting and retaining researchers with an excellent scientific and leadership curriculum. Scientist attraction and retention policies being what they are in Spain, the Andalusian government broke the promises they made to those we came under this scheme and prematurely ended their program. So, here I am. Still working for the University of Seville but with a contract below my professional level given the options were migrating again and uprooting my family, unemployment (given the rigidity and limitations of the Spanish university system), or taking, as 
I did, a Senior Lecturer position and wait 2 years for a "promotion".
