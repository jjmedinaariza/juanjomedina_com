:::{#hero-heading}

I am a social scientist interested in crime and crime control and prevention policies, what is often referred to as a criminologist. After spending much of my career, 25 years, working in the UK and the USA, I left my position as Professor of Quantitative Criminology and Head of the Criminology Department at the University of Manchester in 2020 to join the University of Seville (Spain) as a Talentia Senior Distinguished Researcher. Currently, I am still employed by the University of Seville. I also collaborate with  [FIADYS](https://www.fiadys.org) as an associate researcher and with the  [Institut Metropoli](https://www.institutmetropoli.cat/en/) as an external fellow. Equally, I coordinate, alongside Frances Guillen, the [Police Working Group](https://criminologia.net/grupos-de-trabajo/) of the Spanish Society of Criminology.
